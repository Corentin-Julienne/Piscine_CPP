## 💿 Compilation and Execution

Every module, from 00 to 09, is independant. Each contains a Makefile. Just write ```make``` to compile the project. 

Refers to the PDF of every module to have more information about how to execute the program.

## 🗑️ Deletion

Every module, from 00 to 09, has Makefile rules named ```make fclean``` (clear executable and obj files) and ```make clean``` (clear obj files only).

## ✅ Validation
